parts-test
==========

django test project

Using this project as my avenue for learning Django and CSS

The parts-test implements a simple inventory system with a model of Parts, Suppliers, Bins and Warehouses.

It uses a number of frameworks, mostly for my own learning.  Most notably tables2, bootstrap3.
